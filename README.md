# 🩺 Image-Based Disease Detection  

This project detects diseases from **chest X-ray images** using pre-trained **DenseNet121 models**.  

## 📂 Project Structure  

**Note** : Extract the "chest_xray" and "chest_xray1" then move "chest_xray1" into the "chest_xray" folder then rename the folder "chest_xray1" to "chest_xray".

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions  

1. **Clone the repository / extract files**  
   
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd "IMAGE BASED DISEASE DETECTION"
   

2. **Create virtual environment (optional, recommended)**  
   
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   

3. **Install requirements**  
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  
If pip is not recognized

Use Python with -m pip, Instead of pip install, run:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 Running the Application  

There are **two ways to run the app** depending on your needs:  

### 1. Load model and start app (automatic)  
Run the provided batch files in sequence:  

- **Step 1:** Run the model loader  
 
  Run.bat

  This will **load the pre-trained `.h5` models** (`densenet121_base.h5` or `densenet121_finetuned.h5`).  

- **Step 2:** Launch the web app  
  
  App.bat
 
  This will open the **Streamlit app** in your default browser.  

---

### 2. Train model from scratch (optional)  
If you want to train a new model:  


python Model.py


This will generate a new `.h5` file that can later be loaded using `Run.bat`.



## 📌 Notes  

- Use `densenet121_finetuned.h5` for **higher accuracy**.  
- Make sure the `chest_xray` dataset is available before training.  
- For just running the app, **you don’t need to retrain** — simply use the pre-trained `.h5` files.  
- If you face local host is already in use just type in terminal "streamlit run app.py" and you get the available local host and you can then change it to that host.

---

✅ With this, your workflow is:  
**Train (optional) → Run.bat (load model) → App.bat (launch in browser).**
